# Sieve of Erastosthenes 
The sieve of Erastosthenes is a method of finding prime numbers. The technice can be found on (this wikipedia article)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes].

This repository has the full working code refered on the blog post. My goal is to implement the same algorithm in 4 languages: Java and Python, which I'm quite familiar and, Go and Rust, which I've never seen a line of code. How fun!
